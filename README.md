# QuantGANs-replication
Codes for my thesis project: replicating and modifying quant GANs.

Python files for neural network creation/training, preprocessing and metrics can be found in the backend package.

Replication/testing:
* [S&P 500 QuantGAN training](https://github.com/ICascha/QuantGANs-replication/blob/main/sp500_training.ipynb)
* [Stylized effects of S&P 500 generated paths](https://github.com/ICascha/QuantGANs-replication/blob/main/stylized_facts_sp500.ipynb)
* [Mode collapse of QuantGAns on S&P 500 generated patgs](https://github.com/ICascha/QuantGANs-replication/blob/main/mode_collapse_sp500.ipynb)
